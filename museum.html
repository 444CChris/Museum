            <p>Piano has always been a big part of my life, and I continue to find great joy in playing, listening, and 
                attending live performances that my friends! Music is an important to me because it expresses the nuances
                of my feelings in an experience.

            <p>Coming from colorado (you can see where this is going) I LOVE THE OUTDOORS RAHHHH!!! 
                I quite enjoy just being outdoors and the feeling of the sun on my skin ( much less of that in Seattle :( )
